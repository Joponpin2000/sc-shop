# Getting Started with The App

To run this app, there's a .env.example file that contains the format for the config data needed for the app to run. Create a .env file at the root of the folder and include the respective config inside.

NOTE: Any changes made to the .env file will only reflect after restarting the server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
